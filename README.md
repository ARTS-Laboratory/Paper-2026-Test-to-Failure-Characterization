# Paper-2026-Test-to-Failure-Characterization
Data and Code for the 2026 IMAC paper titled "Test-to-Failure Characterization and Cumulative Damage Modeling of Electronic Systems Under Repeated Shock Loading".

---

## Overview
This repository provides the experimental datasets and analysis scripts developed for the study.  
The work introduces a repeatable test-to-failure framework for printed circuit boards subjected to repeated high-energy shock events, with simultaneous resistance monitoring and high-rate acceleration measurements. Extracted time- and frequency-domain features, along with baseline cumulative damage estimates, are included to support future analysis and reproducibility.

- **Data**: Raw and processed resistance/acceleration signals from repeated shock tests.  
- **Analysis**: Feature extraction, normalization, and analysis scripts.
