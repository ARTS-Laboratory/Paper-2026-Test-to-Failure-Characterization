Data copied from https://github.com/High-Rate-SHM-Working-Group/Dataset-11-rectangular-electronic-SMD-assembly-under-repeated-5-kg-impacts.

Boards 4.3, 4.4, and 4.6 have been renamed 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Each board has a "life-cycle_model_data.lvm" file associated with it. The columns of data in these files are tab delimited. The columns contain the data as follows:
    1: Impact number.
    2: Percentage form of impact number.
    3: Percentage form of actual resistance value.
    4: Percentage form of the trendlines predicted resistance value.
